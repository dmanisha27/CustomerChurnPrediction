# Customer Churn Prediction  

## Overview  
The **Customer Churn Prediction** project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting customer churn for subscription-based services or businesses. By analyzing historical customer data, including usage behavior, demographics, and subscription details, the model identifies customers at risk of canceling their subscriptions. The project is implemented using **Python** and leverages popular libraries for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

## Technology Stack  
This project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:  
- **Python**: Core programming language for data analysis and machine learning.  
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides tools for building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.  
- **Pandas**: Simplifies data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation.  
- **NumPy**: Efficient numerical computations.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualizes patterns and trends in the data.

## Features  
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Importing historical customer datasets for training and testing.  
2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:  
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and normalizing features.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Gaining insights into factors influencing customer churn.  
4. **Model Training and Optimization**:  
   - Experimenting with algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.  
5. **Evaluation**:  
   - Measuring model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset  
The dataset contains historical customer records, typically sourced from subscription-based services. It includes features such as:  
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, location.  
- **Usage Behavior**: Monthly usage statistics, service history.  
- **Subscription Details**: Contract type, tenure, billing method.  
- **Target Variable**: `Churn` (binary - 1 for churn, 0 for retention).  

A sample dataset can be found on **[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction)**.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
### Steps Involved:  
- **Null Value Handling**: Imputed missing values using statistical techniques.  
- **Feature Encoding**: Converted categorical variables to numeric format (e.g., one-hot encoding).  
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied standardization or normalization for numerical stability.  
- **Class Imbalance**: Used techniques like SMOTE to handle imbalanced target classes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Key insights and patterns were uncovered through EDA techniques:  
- **Bar and Pie Charts**: Visualized churn rates across demographics and subscription types.  
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Analyzed relationships among features and the target variable.  
- **Box Plots**: Identified outliers in continuous features like monthly charges.

## Model Development and Evaluation  
### Algorithms Evaluated:  
1. **Logistic Regression**  
2. **Random Forest Classifier**  
3. **Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)**  
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

The best-performing model was selected based on the following metrics:  
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of predictions.  
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positives among predicted positives.  
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positives among actual positives.  
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
